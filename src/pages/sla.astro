      Service Level Agreement (SLA) 
    </h1>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
      This Service Level Agreement (SLA) outlines the expected timelines and escalation procedures for resolving various types of support tickets. It aims to ensure that all tickets are handled in a timely and efficient manner based on their priority level. The SLA defines different categories of support requests, each with specified response and resolution times, as well as escalation rules to guarantee that unresolved issues are promptly addressed by the appropriate team.

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 text-justify">
          <li><strong>Low Priority:</strong> Tickets are handled directly by the support bot to quickly address simple or common concerns. If the bot cannot resolve the issue within the expected timeframe, the ticket will be escalated to an agent.</li>
          <li><strong>Medium & High Priority:</strong> Tickets will be placed in a queue to wait for assignment. Once an agent becomes available, the admin will manually assign the ticket to that agent for handling. This ensures faster ticket allocation while maintaining oversight on case distribution.</li>
