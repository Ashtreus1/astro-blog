    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-6">Service Level Agreement (SLA)</h1>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      This Service Level Agreement (SLA) outlines the expected timelines and escalation procedures for resolving various types of support tickets. It aims to ensure that all tickets are handled in a timely and efficient manner based on their priority level. The SLA defines different categories of support requests, each with specified response and resolution times, as well as escalation rules to guarantee that unresolved issues are promptly addressed by the appropriate team.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">High Priority</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
      Issues such as account lockouts or billing problems must be responded to within <span class="font-semibold">30 minutes to 1 hour</span>. Resolutions are expected within the same period. If unresolved, the issue is escalated to ensure swift action.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Urgent</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
      Critical matters like unauthorized access alerts or threats of violence require <span class="font-semibold">immediate attention</span> and must be escalated directly to the relevant security or legal teams without delay.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Medium Priority</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
      For concerns like product delivery issues or refund requests, the expected response time is <span class="font-semibold">4 hours to 1 business day</span>, with resolutions due within <span class="font-semibold">1 to 3 business days</span>. Escalation occurs if the timeframe is exceeded.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3">Low Priority</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">
      Items like UI/UX bugs or feedback submissions are handled within <span class="font-semibold">1 business day</span> and <span class="font-semibold">7 business days</span>, respectively. Escalation is minimal unless the issue is flagged as critical.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-8">
      This structured approach ensures that customers receive the appropriate level of service based on the urgency and impact of their issues. Unresolved matters are escalated in a timely manner to maintain service standards and operational efficiency.
