When you're facing a technical issue, billing problem, or simply need assistance, submitting a support ticket is the best way to get help. But did you know that the **quality of your ticket can directly impact how fast and effectively support responds?**

In this guide, we’ll explain the **key details** to include when submitting a support ticket and how to write it in a clear, helpful way.

## 🧠 Why Providing Complete Information Matters

Support teams receive hundreds (if not thousands) of tickets each week. When your ticket is vague or missing critical information, it may:

- Get delayed due to back-and-forth follow-up questions.
- Be misunderstood and receive a generic or incorrect response.
- Be deprioritized due to lack of clarity.

A well-written ticket helps our support team respond faster and more effectively. Always try to provide complete and clear information.

## 📝 What to Include in Your Ticket

Here’s a checklist to make sure your support ticket is effective:

✅ **Account Details:**  
Include your registered email or username. This helps the team quickly locate your account.

✅ **Issue Description:**  
Be specific about what went wrong. Instead of saying _"It doesn’t work,"_ explain what you tried to do and what happened as a result. Mention any error messages you encountered.

✅ **Steps to Reproduce:**  
Provide clear steps so the support team can replicate the problem. For example:
1. Go to the dashboard
2. Click “Generate Report”
3. Select a date range
4. Click “Download”
5. See error message

✅ **Screenshots or Files:**  
Attach any images or documents that might help visualize the problem. A screenshot of an error message is often more helpful than a written explanation.

✅ **Device/Browser Info (if applicable):**  
If you're reporting a bug, share details like:
- Device: PC / Mac / iPhone / Android
- Browser: Chrome / Firefox / Safari
- App version or OS version

**✅ Good Ticket Example:**

> I’m trying to export a PDF report from the dashboard. Every time I click "Download", the app crashes.  
>  
> Steps to reproduce:  
> 1. Open Dashboard  
> 2. Select a date range  
> 3. Click “Generate Report”  
> 4. Click “Download as PDF”  
>  
> I’m using Google Chrome on Windows 10. I’ve attached a screenshot of the error message.  
>  
> Please advise. Thank you!
