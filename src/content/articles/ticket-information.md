A well-written ticket helps our support team respond faster and more effectively. Always try to provide complete and clear information.

Here’s what to include:

✅ **Account Details:** Include your registered email or username.  
✅ **Issue Description:** Be specific about what went wrong. Instead of saying "It doesn’t work," explain what you tried to do and what happened.  
✅ **Steps to Reproduce:** List the steps that lead to the issue so we can test it ourselves.  
✅ **Screenshots or Files:** Attach images or files if they help illustrate the problem.
