## 🎯 Why Apps Load Slowly

Apps can slow down due to:

- **Low memory (RAM)** – Too many apps open at once.
- **Corrupted cache data** – Old files may conflict with new app versions.
- **Outdated apps** – Older versions may not run well on newer OS updates.
- **Background services** – Syncing, backups, and push notifications eat up resources.
