## 🌙 Why Standby Drain Happens

Even when idle, devices keep certain processes running. Significant overnight drain may be caused by:

- **Push notifications & syncing** – Email, messaging, and cloud apps constantly check for updates.
- **Background location tracking** – GPS and location services stay active for some apps.
- **Poor signal strength** – Weak cellular or Wi-Fi connection makes the device work harder.
- **Battery-hungry apps** – Apps like social media or games can wake the device repeatedly.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

**Step 1:** **Turn On Airplane Mode at Night**  
If you don’t need connectivity, Airplane Mode prevents unnecessary radio usage.

**Step 2:** **Disable Background App Refresh**  
Stop apps from updating in the background when not in use.

**Step 3:** **Check App Battery Usage**  
Identify apps consuming power overnight and restrict them.

**Step 4:** **Update or Remove Problem Apps**  
Buggy apps can misbehave even when idle — update or uninstall them.

**Step 5:** **Optimize Location Settings**  
Set location services to “While Using the App” instead of “Always.”

## ⚠️ Prevention & Best Practices

- **Use Sleep Mode or Bedtime Mode** – Limits notifications and background processes.
- **Charge Before Bed, Not Overnight** – Avoid trickle-charging all night to reduce wear.
- **Keep Software Updated** – Manufacturers often patch battery drain issues.

## 📌 Quick Recap

Standby battery drain is often a sign of apps or services running unnecessarily in the background. Limiting background activity and optimizing settings can preserve your charge overnight.
