## Why You Should Keep Your Payment Info Up-to-Date

Maintaining an active and valid payment method has several benefits:

- ✅ **Avoid service interruptions** due to failed payments.
- 📅 **Stay on schedule** with subscriptions and auto-renewals.
- 📬 **Receive accurate billing emails** and transaction records.
- 🔐 **Ensure account security** with up-to-date payment platforms.

Outdated or declined cards may result in account deactivation, loss of service access, or late payment fees, depending on your plan and provider.
