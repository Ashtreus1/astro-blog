## 🛑 Common Password Reset Problems

Even the best systems can encounter issues. Here are common reasons your reset might not be working:

- **No reset email received?** It could be in your **spam or junk folder**.
- **Link expired?** Most reset links only last **15–60 minutes**.
- **Link not working?** Try copying and pasting it directly into your browser instead of clicking.
- **Email mismatch?** Make sure you're using the same email you registered with.

## 🔍 How to Troubleshoot a Failed Reset

### ✅ Step 1: Confirm Your Email

Ensure that you're entering your **registered email** exactly as it was when you signed up — even small typos can block the reset process.

### ✅ Step 2: Wait a Few Minutes

There might be a delay, especially during peak hours. Emails usually arrive within **1–5 minutes**.

### ✅ Step 3: Request Again (But Not Too Often)

Clicking “Forgot Password” repeatedly in a short time may flag your request as suspicious.
