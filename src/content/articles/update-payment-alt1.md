## ⚠️ Common Payment Update Errors

### 1. ❌ Card Declined
Double-check:
- Card number
- Expiry date
- CVV
- Sufficient balance

Also ensure the card is enabled for **online and recurring payments**.

### 2. 🔒 Locked Account
If there were failed payment attempts, your account might be temporarily locked. Look for alert banners or check your email for security notices.

### 3. 🕸️ Browser Issues
Try:
- Clearing cache and cookies
- Using a different browser
- Disabling extensions or ad blockers

### 4. 🌍 Wrong Billing Address
Some payment processors require the billing address to exactly match what's on file with your bank.
