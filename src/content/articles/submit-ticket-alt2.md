Not all tickets are created equal. Some get fast resolutions — others sit in the queue. Often, it’s because of how they’re written. Let’s break down what to avoid so your ticket is handled smoothly.

---

## ❌ Mistake #1: Vague Subject Lines

Bad: “Problem!! 😡”  
Better: “Unable to reset password on mobile app”

Why it matters: Good subjects help agents route your ticket correctly and quickly.

---

## ❌ Mistake #2: Missing Details

Saying “It’s broken” won’t help anyone. Be specific:

- What were you trying to do?
- What went wrong?
- What device/browser were you using?

---

## ❌ Mistake #3: Forgetting Attachments

Error screenshots, invoice numbers, or order IDs speed up support. Always include these when possible.

---

## ❌ Mistake #4: Submitting Multiple Tickets

Sending multiple tickets for the same issue won’t get it resolved faster — it just confuses things.

---

## ✅ Better Practice

- Use the correct ticket category.
- Write clear, professional messages.
- Respond promptly if the agent asks for more info.
