Your ticket history provides a full record of past interactions, making it easier to track previous requests and resolutions.

**Step 1:** Log in to your account and navigate to the _"My Tickets"_ section.

**Step 2:** A list of all tickets will be displayed, sorted by the most recent updates. Each entry shows the current status—Open, In Progress, or Closed.

**Step 3:** Click on any ticket to view detailed conversations and responses from the support team. This helps ensure you’re updated on any progress without submitting duplicate requests.
