Support tickets are more than just messages — they contain structured information that helps both you and the support team track, understand, and resolve issues efficiently.

In this article, we’ll break down the common ticket information fields and what each one means.

## 🧾 Common Ticket Fields and What They Mean

When you view a ticket, you'll typically see several fields. Here’s a breakdown:

### 🎫 Ticket ID
A unique identifier automatically assigned to your ticket. Always reference this when following up.

### 📝 Subject or Title
A short summary of your issue. Make it specific, like “Unable to reset password” or “Billing invoice error”.

### 📅 Date Submitted
The exact timestamp when you created the ticket. Useful for tracking how long the issue has been open.

### 🔄 Status
Indicates the ticket’s current state, such as:
- **Open** – waiting for support.
- **In Progress** – being worked on.
- **Resolved** – completed.
- **Pending** – awaiting your response.

### 👤 Assigned Agent
The name or ID of the support staff handling your request. You may also see their recent responses here.

### 💬 Message Thread
The conversation history between you and the support team. This is where all updates, questions, and answers are tracked.

## 🗂️ Additional Fields (Optional but Useful)

Depending on your system, you may also see:

- **Priority level** (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- **Category or department**
- **Related files** or attachments
- **Internal notes** (only visible to agents)
- **Tags** to help organize or search tickets

## 🧠 Why This Information Matters

- Helps avoid duplicate tickets
- Provides context to support agents
- Makes your case easier to escalate if needed

Always keep an eye on the status and timestamps. If the ticket hasn't been updated in a while, it may be time to follow up or reopen it.
