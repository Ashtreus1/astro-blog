Sometimes support tickets may take longer than expected to get a response. If that happens, here’s how you can follow up without getting stuck in a loop.

---

## 📫 First, Double-Check Your Email

- Make sure you're checking the inbox of the email you used to submit the ticket.
- Look in your **Spam or Promotions** folders—sometimes replies get filtered.

---

## ⏰ When Should You Follow Up?

If you haven’t received a response after:

- **48 hours** for low-priority issues
- **24 hours** for medium-priority issues
- **4–8 hours** for high-priority issues

…it’s okay to send a follow-up message.

---

## 🧠 What to Include in Your Follow-Up

- Your original **ticket number** or subject line
- A short note like:  
  _“Just following up on this issue. Any updates?”_

This keeps communication clear and professional.

---

## 📞 Try Alternative Channels

If the matter is urgent, look for:

- A support **hotline**
- **Live chat** on the website
- Official **social media support handles**

These may connect you faster than email alone.
