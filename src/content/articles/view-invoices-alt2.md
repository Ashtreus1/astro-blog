## 🧩 Key Sections of Your Invoice

When you open an invoice, you’ll typically see these major parts:

### 1. Invoice Header
- **Invoice Number** – A unique ID to reference your bill
- **Date Issued** – When the invoice was generated
- **Billing Period** – The service period you're paying for

---

### 2. Customer & Payment Info
- **Name & Address** – Who the invoice is issued to
- **Payment Method** – Credit card, PayPal, bank transfer, etc.
- **Tax ID or VAT Number** – For business customers (when applicable)

---

### 3. Itemized Charges
Each item typically includes:
- **Service Description** – e.g., “Pro Plan Subscription”
- **Quantity or Units** – If usage-based
- **Rate** – Cost per unit or plan
- **Subtotal** – Line-by-line cost

Example:

| Description              | Qty | Unit Price | Total  |

### 4. Taxes & Discounts
- **Sales Tax / VAT** – Varies by location
- **Promotions or Coupons** – Automatically applied if available

---

### 5. Total & Payment Status

## 💡 Pro Tip: Verify Every Charge

Even if everything looks good:
- Compare current invoices with previous ones to spot unexpected increases.
- Double-check whether trial discounts expired or if new charges were added.
- Look for usage spikes if you’re billed per ticket, user, or message.
