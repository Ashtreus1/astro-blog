Not every user can modify a submitted support ticket — and for good reason. Editing permissions help maintain the integrity of communication between you and the support team.

## 🔑 Can I Edit My Ticket After Submission?

Yes, but only certain parts:

- **Message Thread**: You can add follow-up messages or attachments.
- **Ticket Details**: Fields like subject, priority, or category can only be changed within a specific time window.

## 👥 Role-Based Permissions

Here’s how editing access breaks down:

- **End Users**: Can only edit their own tickets (limited to notes or replies).
- **Team Admins**: Can view and edit all team-submitted tickets.
- **Support Agents**: Can edit ticket properties to reassign, escalate, or resolve issues.

## ⚠️ Edit Limits

To prevent confusion or manipulation:

- You can't **change the issue type** after an agent responds.
- Major edits are **logged** in the system for accountability.
- Some organizations disable editing entirely — check your settings.

## 💡 Tip

Instead of editing, use the reply feature to **add context**. It keeps the ticket history clear and improves communication.
