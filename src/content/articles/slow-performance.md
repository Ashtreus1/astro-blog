## 🐢 Why Devices Slow Down

Even high-performance electronics can feel sluggish over time. Common causes include:

- **Insufficient storage space** – When your device is nearly full, it struggles to manage temporary files and processes.
- **Too many background processes** – Apps running in the background use up memory and processing power.
- **Outdated software** – Older operating systems and apps may be less optimized for current performance needs.
- **Overheating** – High temperatures can cause devices to throttle performance to prevent damage.
- **Malware or adware** – Unwanted programs can consume resources and slow everything down.
- **Aging hardware** – Components like storage drives and RAM naturally degrade over years of use.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Speed Boost

**Step 1:** **Free Up Storage**  
Delete unused apps, clear cache data, and remove large files you no longer need. Aim to keep at least 20% of your storage free.

**Step 2:** **Restart Regularly**  
A restart clears background processes and temporary files, giving your device a fresh start.

**Step 3:** **Limit Background Apps**  
Check which apps are running in the background and disable those that aren’t essential.

**Step 4:** **Update Software and Apps**  
Updates often include performance improvements and bug fixes.

**Step 5:** **Scan for Malware**  
Run a security scan to remove harmful software that may be slowing your device.

**Step 6:** **Optimize Settings**  
Lower visual effects, animations, and background refresh rates for better speed.

**Step 7:** **Perform a Factory Reset (Last Resort)**  
If all else fails, a clean reinstall of the system can restore performance—just back up your data first.
