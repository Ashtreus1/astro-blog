## 📶 Why Wi-Fi Disconnections Happen

A device losing Wi-Fi repeatedly can be caused by several issues:

- **Weak signal strength** – Being too far from the router reduces stability.
- **Router interference** – Other electronics like microwaves or cordless phones can interfere.
- **Outdated network drivers** – Old software can cause connection dropouts.
- **Router overload** – Too many devices connected at once can slow or disrupt service.
- **Power-saving settings** – Some devices turn off Wi-Fi to save battery.
- **Faulty hardware** – Damaged antennas or internal components can cause poor reception.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

**Step 1:** **Check Signal Strength**  
Move closer to your router and see if the connection improves. If it does, the issue may be range-related.

**Step 2:** **Restart Your Router and Device**  
Turn both off for at least 30 seconds before restarting. This clears temporary glitches.

**Step 3:** **Forget and Reconnect to the Network**  
Go to your Wi-Fi settings, select your network, and choose *Forget*. Then reconnect by entering your password.

**Step 4:** **Update Network Drivers or Firmware**  
Check your device’s system updates and your router manufacturer’s site for updates.

**Step 5:** **Reduce Interference**  
Keep your router away from thick walls, large appliances, and electronics that can disrupt the signal.

**Step 6:** **Adjust Power Settings**  
On laptops or phones, disable power-saving features that automatically turn off Wi-Fi.

**Step 7:** **Test Another Network**  
Connect your device to a different Wi-Fi network. If it works fine, your router might be the cause.

- Limit the number of devices connected simultaneously.
- Regularly restart your router for optimal performance.
- Protect your Wi-Fi with a strong password to prevent neighbors from using your bandwidth.
- Use a Wi-Fi range extender if you have a large home.
