## 🔍 Where to Find Your Ticket Status

You can track ticket progress in your _"My Tickets"_ dashboard. Each ticket will show its current status (Open, In Progress, or Resolved) and the latest response time. For urgent issues, you can reply in the same ticket to request updates.

### 🧭 Steps to Check Your Ticket Status:

1. Navigate to your **User Dashboard**.
2. Click on the **“My Tickets”** section.
3. You’ll see a list of all submitted tickets along with:
   - **Ticket ID**
   - **Title/Subject**
   - **Current Status**
   - **Last Updated Date**
4. Click on a ticket to view full conversation history and response timelines.

## 🟢 What Do Ticket Statuses Mean?

Understanding what each status indicates helps set the right expectations.

### 🟢 **Open**
> The ticket has been received by the system but has not yet been reviewed by the support team.

- You may still edit or update the ticket.
- Response time varies based on priority.

### 🟡 **In Progress**
> A support agent is actively working on your issue or awaiting additional information.

- You can still add comments or attachments.
- Keep an eye on reply timestamps.

### ✅ **Resolved**
> The issue has been addressed and marked as completed by the support team.

- No further updates are expected unless you reopen the ticket.
- A satisfaction survey may be sent after this stage.

## 🧠 Tips for Faster Support

Want to speed up ticket resolution? Try the following:

- **Include all necessary details upfront** (e.g., screenshots, device info, steps to reproduce).
- **Avoid opening multiple tickets** for the same issue.
- **Reply within the same thread** if you have follow-ups.

> _Pro Tip: The more detailed your initial message is, the less back-and-forth is needed later._

## 📬 What If There's No Update?

It’s rare, but delays can happen due to high ticket volume or technical escalations. If you feel your ticket hasn’t received attention within the expected timeframe:

- Check if the status is still **Open** or **In Progress**.
- Add a polite comment asking for a follow-up.
- Contact support through live chat or phone (if available) and mention your **ticket ID**.
