A good system should feel natural and easy to use. But when it doesn’t, **usability issues** may be to blame. These are problems that make it hard for users to interact with the system effectively — and they can occur even when everything is technically “working.”

In this guide, we’ll explain the **most common usability problems**, how to recognize them, and what to include when reporting them to our team.

## 🔍 What Are Usability Issues?

Usability issues affect **how usable** or user-friendly a system is. They don't always involve errors or broken features — sometimes it’s about how confusing, slow, or frustrating something feels to use.

### Types of usability problems:
- Poor layout or cluttered interface
- Inconsistent button behavior
- Lack of feedback after an action
- Non-responsive or hard-to-use mobile design
- Labels that are unclear or misleading
- Important features that are hard to find

## 🧪 Examples of Real Usability Problems

Here’s what you might encounter:

### 1. 🔘 Misleading Buttons
You click a button expecting one result — but something unexpected happens. For example, a “Save” button that closes the page without confirmation.

### 2. 📱 Mobile Struggles
Buttons too small to tap? Layouts breaking on your phone? These are classic mobile usability problems.

### 3. ⏳ No Feedback
You submit a form, but nothing happens visually. Did it work? Should you click again? Lack of confirmation is a major friction point.

### 4. 🧭 Navigation Confusion
You can't find the feature you're looking for. Menus are hidden or scattered in non-intuitive places.

## 💬 How to Report Usability Issues Effectively

To help us fix problems faster, include these details:

- **What were you trying to do?** (e.g., "I wanted to update my email")
- **What happened instead?** (e.g., "The page reloaded and cleared my data")
- **Where did this happen?** (e.g., "Settings > Account Info")
- **Device info**: Phone or desktop? Browser and version?

Attach a **screenshot or screen recording** if possible. A visual can help us pinpoint the issue quickly.

## 💡 What Makes a Site Truly Usable?

A usable interface is:
- **Clear** – Users don’t need instructions to use it
- **Consistent** – Buttons and actions behave the same way everywhere
- **Responsive** – Works well on all devices and screen sizes
- **Helpful** – Shows feedback, tooltips, and messages
- **Forgiving** – Lets users undo actions or fix mistakes
