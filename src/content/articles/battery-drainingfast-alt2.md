Software updates can temporarily impact battery life due to:

- **Re-indexing** – The system reorganizes files and data after major updates.
- **Background syncing** – Apps may refresh and re-download data.
- **New features** – Extra features may consume more resources.
- **Bugs** – Some updates introduce unintended battery issues.
