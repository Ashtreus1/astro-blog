## 🧠 Rethink Your Password Strategy

Most people choose passwords that are **easy to remember** — but also easy to guess.

Here's how to break that pattern:

- ❌ Avoid names, birthdays, or simple words.
- ❌ Don’t use the same password across multiple accounts.
- ✅ Use **long phrases** or **passcodes** instead.

Example:
> “Lemon$TeaAt4pm” is much stronger than “Lemon123”
