Tracking your support ticket shouldn't feel like a mystery. Here are three easy ways you can check the status of your open requests.

---

## 1. 🎫 Ticket Dashboard

Once you log into your support portal:

- Navigate to **My Tickets** or **Ticket History**
- Look for a **status badge** like “Open,” “In Progress,” or “Resolved”
- Click a ticket to view full details, messages, and agent replies

---

## 2. 📩 Email Updates

Most systems send updates automatically:

- When a support agent responds
- When your ticket status changes
- When additional info is requested

⚠️ _Tip:_ Be sure to check your **spam folder** just in case.

## 3. 🔔 Notifications (Mobile/Desktop)

If you’re using a mobile app or have browser notifications enabled:

- Get instant alerts for replies
- Tap or click the notification to view the latest update

## 🕒 How Often Are Tickets Updated?

Response time depends on your plan and issue severity. But rest assured, all updates will reflect in real-time on your dashboard.
