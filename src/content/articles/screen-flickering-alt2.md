## 🎯 Why App-Specific Flicker Happens

When flickering appears only in certain programs, it usually means:

- **Graphics compatibility issues** – The app’s rendering settings conflict with your device’s hardware.
- **Corrupt app data** – Damaged cache or files may cause unstable visuals.
- **Outdated app version** – Old versions may have bugs not fixed until later updates.
- **Hardware acceleration settings** – Misconfigured acceleration can cause rendering glitches.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

**Step 1:** **Update the App**  
Install the latest version to benefit from bug fixes.

**Step 2:** **Clear Cache/Data**  
Removing temporary files can fix corruption issues.

**Step 3:** **Adjust In-App Graphics Settings**  
Lower resolution or disable special effects like motion blur.

**Step 4:** **Disable Hardware Acceleration**  
In some apps, turning this off resolves flicker.

**Step 5:** **Test Another App**  
If other apps work fine, the issue is likely app-specific.
