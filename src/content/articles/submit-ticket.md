## 📬 Why Submit a Ticket?

While live chat or forums are great for general inquiries, tickets allow our support team to:

- Access your account history
- Track ongoing technical issues
- Assign your concern to the right specialist
- Provide detailed, documented responses

Tickets are especially useful for account-specific or technical issues.
