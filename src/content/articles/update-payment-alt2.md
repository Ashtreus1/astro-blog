Do you use more than one card or payment method for different purposes? Good news — most platforms now let you store and manage **multiple payment methods** on your account.

This guide explains how to **add, remove, or prioritize** your payment options for seamless billing.

## ➕ Adding More Than One Payment Method

1. Go to your **Billing Settings**.
2. Click **Add New Payment Method**.
3. Enter the details for your additional credit card, PayPal account, or bank account.
4. Confirm and save the new method.

Once added, you’ll usually see a list of all your saved payment options.

## 📌 Choosing a Primary Method

Most systems allow you to set a **primary/default** payment method. This is the one used automatically for:

- Monthly subscriptions
- One-time purchases
- Upcoming invoice settlements

To set your primary method:
- Click the **Set as Default** button beside the method.
- You should see it marked as your default instantly.

## 🔄 Switching Payment Methods for a Single Invoice

Need to pay an invoice with a different card just once?

1. Go to your **Invoices** section.
2. Select the unpaid invoice.
3. Choose “Change Payment Method” before submitting.
4. Pick a different method from your list.

> This won’t change your default setting — it’s just for that transaction.

## ❌ Removing Old or Expired Cards

To clean up outdated methods:
1. Head to the **Payment Methods** section.
2. Click the **Delete** or **Remove** option next to the card.
3. If it’s your current default, you’ll need to assign a new default before removing.

## 🛑 Important Notes

- Some services allow a **backup method** in case the default fails.
- You **can’t remove** the only payment method on file if you have an active subscription.
- Changes may take a few minutes to reflect — be patient before refreshing or retrying.
