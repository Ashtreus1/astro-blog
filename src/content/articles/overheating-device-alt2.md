## 🎯 Why Gaming Causes Overheating

Gaming pushes your device’s hardware to the limit:

- **High CPU/GPU usage** – 3D graphics require constant processing power.
- **Background sync and updates** – Apps running in the background compete for resources.
- **Poor cooling design** – Some devices don’t have strong heat dissipation systems.
- **High brightness and data usage** – Both add extra strain.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

**Step 1:** **Lower In-Game Graphics**  
Reduce resolution and disable high frame rate mode.

**Step 2:** **Use Game Mode or Performance Settings**  
Some devices optimize resource use during gaming.

**Step 3:** **Close Background Apps**  
Give your game full access to processing power.

**Step 4:** **Play in Cooler Environments**  
Fans or air-conditioning help reduce device temperature.

**Step 5:** **Take Breaks**  
Let the device rest every 30–45 minutes.
