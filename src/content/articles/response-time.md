When reaching out to support, one of the most common questions customers have is: **"When will I get a reply?"** While teams aim to respond as quickly as possible, several factors affect response times — including the nature of your issue and the current ticket volume.

---

## 📊 Typical Response Times

Response times depend on issue complexity and current ticket volume. Standard tickets are usually answered within **24 to 48 hours**, while urgent ones are prioritized and responded to within **12 hours**.

| Ticket Type | Estimated Response Time |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Standard    | 24–48 hours             |
| Urgent      | Within 12 hours         |
| Low Priority| 2–3 business days       |

> _Note: Times may vary slightly during weekends or holidays._

## ⏳ What Affects Response Speed?

Here are some common factors that may impact how quickly you get a response:

- 📈 **Ticket Volume** – A high volume of incoming tickets might cause delays.
- 🧩 **Issue Complexity** – Technical issues that need escalation or investigation may take longer.
- 🔁 **Incomplete Information** – Tickets missing details (like screenshots, error messages, or user info) require follow-ups, which delay resolution.
- 🕵️‍♀️ **Third-Party Involvement** – If your issue involves third-party services (e.g., payment providers), it might take longer to coordinate a solution.

## 🏷️ How We Prioritize Tickets

To ensure fairness and effectiveness, tickets are prioritized based on urgency and impact:

- ✅ **Urgent**: Account access issues, service outages, or billing errors.
- 📦 **Standard**: General inquiries, minor bugs, or usage guidance.
- 🧾 **Low Priority**: Feature requests or feedback that doesn’t require action.

If you believe your ticket is urgent, make sure to **mark it as urgent** during submission and include the reason. This helps our team prioritize it appropriately.

## 🚀 What If You Haven’t Heard Back?

If you haven’t received a response within the expected timeframe, consider:

- 🕓 Checking your **spam/junk folder**.
- 🔄 Logging into your dashboard to see if an agent responded.
- 💬 Replying to your own ticket to “bump” it (this reactivates it in many systems).

> Still waiting? Contact support through an alternate method or submit a new ticket referencing the old one.
