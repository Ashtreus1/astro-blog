## 🔍 Why It Happens

Overheating during charging is common but not always normal. Common causes include:

- **Fast charging technology** – High wattage charging generates more heat.
- **Damaged charging cable or adapter** – Faulty accessories can overwork the battery.
- **Background apps running** – More processing means more heat.
- **Poor ventilation** – Charging on a bed, sofa, or under a pillow traps heat.

Avoid direct sunlight or hot rooms.

**Step 3:** **Close Background Apps**  
Especially games, streaming apps, or camera apps.

**Step 4:** **Avoid Using Device While Charging**  
This puts extra load on the processor.

**Step 5:** **Check for Battery Damage**  
Bulging or discoloration means it’s time for a replacement.
