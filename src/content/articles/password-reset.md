## 🔄 Why a Secure Reset Process Matters

Your password is the first line of defense against unauthorized access. When it's lost or forgotten, the reset process becomes the gateway back into your account. If not done securely, it can also become an entry point for attackers.

This is why platforms implement **email verification**, **one-time tokens**, and **expiry limits** during the reset process.
