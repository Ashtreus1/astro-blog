Forgetting a password happens to everyone, but the good news is that resetting it is quick and easy. A secure password reset process ensures both convenience and protection for your account.

**Step 1:** Navigate to the login page and click the *"Forgot Password"* link. You will be prompted to enter the email address associated with your account.

**Step 2:** Check your inbox for a reset link. This email may take a few minutes to arrive, and sometimes it can be in your spam folder, so make sure to check there as well.

**Step 3:** Click the reset link provided. You will be redirected to a secure page where you can enter a new password. Choose something strongâ€”combine letters, numbers, and symbols for better security.

**Step 4:** Confirm your new password and save changes. You can now log in immediately with your updated credentials.

If you do not receive a reset email after a few minutes, try requesting it again or contact support for assistance.
