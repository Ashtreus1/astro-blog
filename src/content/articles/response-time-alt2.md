Waiting for a reply from support can be frustrating—but setting realistic expectations helps reduce stress and keeps your workflow smooth.

---

## 📊 Know the SLA (Service Level Agreement)

Many support teams operate under an SLA. This outlines:

- Response time for different priority levels
- Working hours and availability
- What is considered “urgent” or “non-urgent”

Check the company’s support policy or FAQ section to know what to expect.

## 🔁 Response Time ≠ Resolution Time

Just because you got a reply doesn’t mean the problem is fixed yet. Some issues may require:

- Internal discussions
- Engineering involvement
- Additional information from you

---

## ⏲️ Tips to Minimize Wait Times

- Use **tags or categories** properly when submitting your ticket.
- Select the correct **urgency** level (don’t mark everything critical).
- Submit during **business hours** if possible.

---

## ✅ Manage Your Time While Waiting

While waiting for support:

- Continue with other tasks
- Prepare additional documentation or logs
- Avoid submitting duplicate tickets—it slows everyone down
