## 💡 Why Low-Brightness Flicker Happens

Flickering at low brightness often relates to how your device controls its display:

- **Pulse-width modulation (PWM)** – Many screens dim by flickering the backlight quickly, which is more visible at lower settings.
- **Driver or firmware issues** – Outdated display drivers can cause unstable brightness control.
- **Loose display connection** – If cables are not secure, voltage fluctuations may cause visible flicker.
- **Graphics settings** – Incompatible refresh rates or power-saving modes can interfere with display stability.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

**Step 1:** **Increase Brightness Slightly**  
Raising brightness above 30–40% may reduce flicker caused by PWM.

**Step 2:** **Update Graphics Drivers**  
Ensure your display and graphics card drivers are up to date.

**Step 3:** **Change Refresh Rate**  
In display settings, try a higher refresh rate to stabilize visuals.

**Step 4:** **Check Display Cables**  
For external monitors, reseat or replace cables.

**Step 5:** **Disable Adaptive Brightness**  
Sometimes automatic brightness adjustments cause unstable lighting.

## ⚠️ Prevention & Best Practices

- **Use Stable Power** – Unstable voltage can cause screen behavior issues.
- **Avoid Extreme Brightness** – Balance brightness for both comfort and stability.
- **Keep Firmware Updated** – Manufacturers patch many display bugs through updates.

## 📌 Quick Recap

Low-brightness flicker is often linked to display technology or outdated drivers. Adjusting settings and updating software usually resolves the issue.
