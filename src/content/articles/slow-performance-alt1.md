## 🔍 Why It Happens

Updates are meant to improve performance, but sometimes they can cause slowdowns due to:

- **Background re-indexing** – Your device reorganizes files after updates.
- **New features consuming resources** – Extra functions may require more power.
- **Bugs in the update** – Glitches can affect speed.
- **Incompatible apps** – Some apps may not be optimized for the new system.
